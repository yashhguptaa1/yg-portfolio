So you want to pre-generate the page dynamically on the fly after deployment on the server.
Not during the build process and not every couple of seconds,
but for every request. And if that's your goal,
then there is an alternative to getStaticProps.

A function that can also be async if you want to.
And that's the getServerSideProps function.
And the difference to getStaticProps
is that this function will now not run
during the build process,
but instead always on the server after deployment.
Now you will still return an object here,
an object with a props property,
because after all, this function still is
about getting the props for this page component.
And you can still then fetch data from an API here,
or from the file system, whatever you want to do.
Any code you write in here will always run on the server,
never in the client.
So you can run the server side code in here,
you can also perform operations that use credentials
that should not be exposed to your users,
because this code only runs on the server.
And then ultimately, you return your props object.

This getServerSideProps function runs
for every incoming requests anyways,
so there is no need to revalidate every x seconds.
Ultimately, you then don't return a response
by working on that response object here,
but instead, you return this object with the props key,
which holds the props for this page component function.
So that is how you then can use getServerSideProps
for preparing that data for your page.


Now, which one of the two should you use?
Is getServerSideProps better or getStaticProps?
getServerSideProps might sound better
because it's guaranteed to run for every request.
But that actually can be a disadvantage,
because that means that you need to wait for your page
to be generated on every incoming request.
Now if you don't have data that changes all the time,
and with that, I really mean
that it changes multiple times every second.
And if you don't need access to the request object,
let's say for authentication,
getStaticProps is actually better.
Because there you pre-generate an HTML file,
that file can then be stored and served by a CDN.
And that simply is faster than regenerating
and fetching that data for every incoming request.
So your page will be faster when working
with getStaticProps, because then it can be cached
and reused, instead of regenerated all the time.
Hence, you should really only use getServerSideProps
if you need access to that concrete request object,
because you don't have access to request
and response in getStaticProps.
Or if you really have data
that changes multiple times every second,
then therefore even revalidate won't help you,
then getServerSideProps is a great choice.
Now here for our meetup list, though,
it's not a great choice, because that is not data,
which changes frequently.
And here I also don't need to work
with the incoming request.
And therefore I will comment getServerSideprops out again,
and comment getStaticProps in.
Because with that, we can take advantage of the caching
and we're not regenerating the page multiple times,
unnecessarily.
