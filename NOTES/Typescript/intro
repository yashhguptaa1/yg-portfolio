TypeScript is a so-called "superset" to JavaScript.
It's a programming language which builds up on JavaScript.
It extends JavaScript you could say,
and that is really important.
The core programming language still, is JavaScript.
So the base JavaScript syntax you know,
how you write JavaScript code,
if statements, for loops, objects, all that does not change.
But TypeScript then adds more features
to the JavaScript syntax, and that's also important.
Unlike React, TypeScript is not a library for JavaScript,
so it doesn't use JavaScript features
to build new features on top of them,
to build functionalities around them.
But instead it extends the core JavaScript syntax,
and most importantly, it adds static typing to JavaScript.
And that's also where the name comes from, TypeScript.
It adds static typing to JavaScript,
because JavaScript on its own is actually dynamically typed.

Which means that this function here,
does not expect any particular types.
It just knows that it will receive two parameters,
and that's it.
So it's not statically typed,
the types for this function are not announced ahead of time,
instead it just takes whatever it gets
and then tries to execute this code.
