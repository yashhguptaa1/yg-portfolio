_app.js ..............................................................................
If we have an application with dozens or maybe hundreds of pages so going into all the page components to then wrap layout
around the content that becomes cumbersome,and that's now where this _app.js file becomes important.
This is a special file, which exists
in this Pages folder out of the box
This special component acts as the root component NextJS will render.

It receives props and uses object de-structuring here
to pull information out of the props and the information it pulls out there,
is a component prop and a page prop.
These props are passed into this MyApp component automatically by NextJS,
since NextJS is the thing using that specific component.
and component is a prop that holds the actual page
contents that should be rendered.
So it will be different whenever we switch a page and page props are specific props
our pages might be getting,
But with that, we now know that component here
in this _app.js file will in the end
be the actual page content of our different pages.

we can utilize this _app.js file and simply wrap this component here
with our layout or with whichever wrapper you have.
And we then don't have to do it inside of our different page files.

And that means that our different page contents
will be wrapped with this layout component.
And hence, if we now save all files
So whenever you have some component
or some setting that affects all your pages
you can utilize this _app.js file to easily add
that without diving into dozens of files individually.
